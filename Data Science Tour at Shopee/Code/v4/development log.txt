This file is to record the development process of the GRU4REC model

a. Input of model: 
    one-hot item id (connected to a trainable embedding)
    processed vec of the item description
    
    if you also count the hidden state from step t-1: 
    the softmax activated group of hidden state 9same size with num_units in GRU from the previous step
    
    
b. Output of the model:
    a softmax activated group of scores, which measures the probability of each item
    
    
    
    
c. Modify the config file, input the hyperparameters for GRU4REC
    "num_steps": 2,             suppose we are not doing the multi-length sequence at the first place
    "emb_size": 150,            suppose the dimension to be 150
    "w2v_size": 1000,           words to vectors input
    "num_item": 10000000,       item amount in Shopee SG
    "num_layers": 1,            number of layers, currently we are not planning to employ deep GRU/RNN
    "dropout": 0.0,             portion of neurons to dropout
    "num_units_4emb": 300,      number of hidden units for the embedding based GRU
    "
    
    
d. About building embeddings:
    need to find a way to save the embedding trained
   
    
e. About data enhancement:
    if we want to do the data enhancement which augments the data by different time steps
    seems at least the step length of data in same batch need to be the same 
    i.e. we need to create multiple group of training data with their own labeling
    
f. About the shape of the label / model-I/O:
    I guess to keep the shape of index input and y the same is a must
